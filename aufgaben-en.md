💡 Individual Learning Phase (ILP) in the Afternoon

Dear Participant,

Welcome to your individual learning phase! This is your very own personal space to dive deep into the subject matter, discover new things, and deepen your knowledge independently. Consider this time a unique opportunity to learn, experiment, and reflect at your own pace. Here you are free to lose yourself, ask questions, and find solutions – detached from the direct rhythm of a group. Use these hours not only to understand concepts but to truly grasp them and lay a solid foundation for your next steps. We are convinced that through this independent work, you will gain valuable insights and fully unfold your potential. Good luck and exciting discoveries!

## 🖥️ Task 1: Introduction to Windows Server 2025 – Your First Overview

**Estimated Time:** approx. 50 minutes

### 📚 Your Mission: Understand Functions and Evolution

Your first step is to gain a solid overview of the current capabilities of Windows Server 2025 and to comprehend its evolution compared to previous versions.

#### 🎯 Subtask 1.1: Exploring the Core Functions of Windows Server 2025
*(approx. 25 minutes)*
Research and identify the most important new and improved features of Windows Server 2025. Focus on areas such as Hybrid Cloud integration, security, containerization, edge computing, and performance improvements. Make a bullet-point list of which functions you consider particularly relevant for modern server infrastructures and why.

#### 🎯 Subtask 1.2: The Journey of Windows Server – Differences from Earlier Versions
*(approx. 25 minutes)*
Compare Windows Server 2025 with its direct predecessors (e.g., Windows Server 2022, 2019). What significant innovations or changed approaches do you notice? Which older functions might have been deprecated or replaced by more modern alternatives? Try to identify at least three significant differences and explain why they are important.

## ⚙️ Task 2: The Installation of Windows Server – Cornerstone of Your Environment

**Estimated Time:** approx. 60 minutes

### 🛠️ Your Mission: Plan and Understand a Server Installation

Now it's time for the nitty-gritty! Even if you don't have a physical machine available yet, you will prepare the installation in detail and mentally walk through its execution.

#### 🎯 Subtask 2.1: Preparation is Everything – The Planning Phase
*(approx. 20 minutes)*
Imagine you are tasked with installing Windows Server 2025 on a virtual server. Which steps are necessary *before* the actual installation? Think about hardware requirements (CPU, RAM, storage), network planning (IP addresses, DNS), licensing, selection of installation media, and the edition (e.g., Standard, Datacenter). Create a checklist of the most important points you would consider before installation.

#### 🎯 Subtask 2.2: Performing a Virtual Installation (simulated/planned)
*(approx. 40 minutes)*
Describe in detail the individual steps you would perform during the installation of Windows Server 2025 on a virtual machine. Starting from booting from the installation media, through partitioning the hard drive, up to the initial configuration settings such as choosing the installation type (Server Core vs. Desktop Experience) and setting the administrator password. Try to imagine every click and every input.

## 🖥️ Task 3: User Interface and Windows Admin Center – Your Command Center

**Estimated Time:** approx. 40 minutes

### 🔍 Your Mission: Get to Know and Set Up Windows Admin Center

The management of modern servers is increasingly done through central tools. Windows Admin Center (WAC) is a key tool here.

#### 🎯 Subtask 3.1: Windows Admin Center (WAC) – What, Why, How?
*(approx. 20 minutes)*
Research: What exactly is Windows Admin Center? What advantages does it offer over traditional management tools like Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) or direct server management via RDP? Where do you usually install WAC, and what prerequisites must be met? Describe in your own words why WAC is considered a modern management solution.

#### 🎯 Subtask 3.2: Introduction, Installation, and First Steps in WAC
*(approx. 20 minutes)*
Imagine you have just installed Windows Server 2025. Now describe the necessary steps to install Windows Admin Center on a separate workstation and add your newly installed server to it. What basic navigation options and user interface customizations would you explore first after the initial login to get an overview of your server (e.g., Dashboard, Roles and Features, Event Logs)?
