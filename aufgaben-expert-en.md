## Task 1: Windows Server 2025 – Strategic Classification and Technology Comparison

**Estimated Time:** approx. 40 minutes

In this task, you will focus on the conceptual foundations and strategic importance of Windows Server 2025 within the current server ecosystem.

### 1.1 Evaluation of Windows Server 2025 Core Features

Research the primary innovations and enhanced features of Windows Server 2025. Create an overview evaluating the potential impact of these features on modern IT infrastructures. Consider aspects such as security, hybrid cloud integration, performance, and automation.

### 1.2 Critical Analysis of Version Differences

Compare Windows Server 2025 with its direct predecessors (e.g., Windows Server 2022 and 2019). Identify at least three significant differences in terms of architecture, management strategies, or roles/features that might justify or challenge a migration. Justify your assessment of which of these differences are most relevant for a long-term IT strategy.

## Task 2: Advanced Installation Strategies and Their Implications

**Estimated Time:** approx. 65 minutes

This task deepens your understanding of planning and performing Windows Server installations, considering advanced requirements.

### 2.1 Conception of Robust Installation Preparation

Develop a concept for preparing a Windows Server 2025 installation in an enterprise environment. Go beyond basic hardware requirements and consider:
*   Planning of storage configurations (e.g., RAID levels, Storage Spaces Direct compatibility).
*   Network integration (e.g., VLAN tagging, NIC Teaming strategies).
*   Security aspects (e.g., Secure Boot, TPM integration, disk encryption during installation).
*   Strategies for unattended installations (e.g., use of answer files like `unattend.xml` and their key parameters).

### 2.2 Analysis of Installation Methods and Deployment Models

Examine various methods for deploying Windows Server (e.g., via ISO, WDS, PXE, Virtual Machine templates). Discuss the pros and cons of installing Windows Server 2025 as "Server Core" compared to "Desktop Experience" regarding:
*   Resource consumption.
*   Management effort and required tools.
*   Security and attack surface.
*   Use cases in a modern IT environment.

## Task 3: Windows Admin Center (WAC) – Gateway to Hybrid Server Management

**Estimated Time:** approx. 55 minutes

In this task, you will intensively explore Windows Admin Center as a central management tool.

### 3.1 Evaluation of Windows Admin Center (WAC) and Its Installation

Research the strategic role of Windows Admin Center in the context of modern server management, especially in hybrid environments (on-premises and Azure). Investigate the different installation options for WAC (e.g., on a client, as a gateway server, highly available) and the associated considerations (certificate management, port configuration, authentication mechanisms). Create a checklist for a secure and efficient WAC implementation.

### 3.2 Advanced Use and Customization of the WAC User Interface

Explore the possibilities for navigating and customizing the Windows Admin Center user interface. Discover how you can:
*   Integrate custom tools and scripts (e.g., PowerShell scripts) into WAC.
*   Use WAC for managing specific, advanced server roles (e.g., Storage Spaces Direct, Hyper-V clusters).
*   Link WAC with Azure services (e.g., Azure Monitor, Azure Update Management via Azure Arc) to enable consolidated management.

### Your Self-Reflection

At the end of this learning phase, take a moment to reflect on the tasks you have completed.

*   What new insights have you gained that significantly broadened your understanding of Windows Server 2025?
*   Which task did you find most challenging and why? How did you approach the solution?
*   Are there any areas you would like to delve deeper into or questions that have arisen that you want to pursue further?
*   How could you apply the knowledge gained in a real project or work environment?

Briefly record your thoughts. This will help you internalize your learning progress and formulate future learning goals.
